**### In progress!**

## Resume

This project aims to find out information about over 16000 movies, completing their information with the New York Times Movies Reviews API.

The idea is allowing the user to filter movies with arguments from the keyboard, and offering to open the url for the review of a selected movie.

At last, a global report is developed as PDF file and sent by mail.

The project is developed in Python, and the main script (main.py) is thought to be runned from the terminal.


## Resources
For this project, the following APIs have been used. Specially thanks to their contributors for spreading so rich information:

* **Food Images (Food-101)**--> https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41
The dataset contains a number of different subsets of the full food-101 data. The idea is to make a more exciting simple training set for image analysis than CIFAR10 or MNIST. For this reason the data includes massively downscaled versions of the images to enable quick tests. 

The data has been reformatted as HDF5 and specifically Keras HDF5Matrix which allows them to be easily read in. The file names indicate the contents of the file. 

On behalf of data protection, the dataset has not been uploaded to Github.

* **FourSquare API**--> https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api-reference

This dataset contains over 16000 movie an TV series and their appearance on different streamming platforms.


* **Spoonacular API**--> https://spoonacular.com/food-api/

The spoonacular Nutrition, Recipe, and Food API allows you to access over 365,000 recipes and 86,000 food products. It makes it possible to search for recipes using natural language queries, such as "gluten free brownies without sugar" or "low fat vegan cupcakes." 

It also calculates the nutritional information for any recipe, which will be used for this project.



## Structure

1) README.txt: As a resume for the content of the project an its development

2) server.py: It contains the main script for the project





6) src: It contains relevant files so that the code can be runned. These are .py files

7) output: It contains the extracted information from the code. For this project, graphs and a report in PDF have been taken out
